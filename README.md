You can visit the Horiseon website by clicking [HERE](https://nikola84ca.github.io/Horiseon-SEO-Project/).

## Website decription

The website is a single page that consists of several elements.

* 1 - An Header were we find the company name/logo and includes three links pointing to specific sections of the page.
* 2 - A big background image that is indicative to the company sector
* 3 - A main article that occupies the 75% of the screen, divided in a big article consisting of three sections describing the company services, each one accessible through the relative links in the header.
* 4 - A side column that occupies the 20% of the screen on the right of the main article that describes the benefits of working with Horiseon.
* 5 - A footer with the copyright.

Here is an example of the functionality implemented in the header links; when clicked they direct the user to the relative section of the main article.

## What is this project about?

This project is meant to improve SEO and Accessibility of Horiseon Website, in order to make the company website rank better on search engines and offer a more inclusive experience for all users, especially those with disabilities who require assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. This is a fundamental improvement that will allow not only a better SEO but also will avoid litigation that can occur when these cannot access their website due to accessibility issues. As a marketing agency, it is fundamental that their website reflects the services they provide, in order to make their website not only rank high on search engines but also make the website accessible to all users. Accessibility, together with a semantic HTML structure are some of the pillars of SEO, and in this project, we are going to improve those elements to make sure Horiseon's website complies with modern standards.

## My Process

* The first thing I did was looking for all the non-semantic elements, unnecessary generic divs and create a more organized, clear and logical structure of the HTML code. This image shows an example of the original HTML code.




* I made sure that all images and icons had a proper alt text to be show in case of an image broken link or for those users who require assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers.




## Upcoming Improvements

Although the website is optimized for desktop view, it is still not responsive for tablet and mobile usage. The next steps to offer a more accessible and performant user experience is to work on the CSS of the website in order to make the website responsive and easy to navigate on all other devices as well. Other important additions could be implemented with detailed JavaScript code to make the website more functional and interactive for users.
